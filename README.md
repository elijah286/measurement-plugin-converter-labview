## Introduction

The Measurement Plug-In Converter is a tool to convert LabVIEW (*.vi) measurements into [measurement
plug-ins](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/measurementplugins/page/measurement-plugins.html).

> [!NOTE]  
> The tool automates the conversion process by automatically transforming selected LabVIEW
> measurements into Measurement Plug-ins to a **certain extent**, with minimal manual wiring
> required to finalize the setup.

## Installation

Download and install the `ni_measurement_plugin_converter-X.X.X.X.vip` package from the latest
release assets.

## How to Convert LabVIEW Measurements?

1. Launch LabVIEW and navigate to `Tools` → `Plug-In SDKs` → `Measurements` → `Convert
   Measurements...`.  
   ![Launch Tool](./docs/Images/README/Launch%20Tool.png)
2. Select the LabVIEW project in which the measurements are to be converted into measurement
   plugins.  
   1. A new LabVIEW project will be created if the project does not exist.
3. Select measurement VI or the folder containing the measurements and click `Next`.  
   ![Home Page](./docs/Images/README/Home%20Page.png)
4. All VIs in the selected directory and its subdirectories will be listed.
   1. Select the measurement(s) to convert and click `Next`.  
   ![Measurement Selection Page](./docs/Images/README/Measurement%20Selection%20Page.png)
5. [Optional] Edit the Measurement plug-in names for the selected VI(s).
6. Click `Start Conversion`.  
   ![Review Plug-in Name Page](./docs/Images/README/Review%20Plug-in%20Name%20Page.png)
7. Once the conversion is complete, the LabVIEW project with the converted measurements will open
   and the conversion status will be displayed on the conversion tool window.  
   ![Conversion Status Page](./docs/Images/README/Conversion%20Status%20Page.png)
8. Click `Review Plug-ins`. All the successfully converted measurements will be listed in the
   dropdown.
   1. Select a plug-in from the dropdown to review the plug-in's Measurement UI, Measurement Logic
      and Type Specialization VIs.  
   ![Review Plug-in Page](./docs/Images/README/Review%20Plug-in%20Page.png)
9. Click `Start Next Conversion` to convert the next set of measurements.

## How to Connect the Wires in Measurement Logic VI?

1. Wire the Pin Names to the corresponding input of the `Get Resource Details.vim`.  
   ![Get Resource Details](./docs/Images/README/Get%20Resource%20Details.png)
2. Connect the channel output of the `Get Resource Details.vim` to the channel name for the
   measurement using the channel-specific instruments.  
   ![Connect Channel Wires](./docs/Images/README/Connect%20Channel%20Wires.png)
3. Connect the corresponding session output of the `Get Resource Details.vim` to the respective
   resource name in the wrapper.  
   ![Connect Session Wires](./docs/Images/README/Connect%20Session%20Wires.png)

### Additional Steps for VISA Instruments

1. In `Measurement Logic.vi`, the instrument type id must be replaced with the instrument name
   specified in the PinMap.  
   ![Measurement Logic VISA](./docs/Images/README/Measurement%20Logic%20VISA.png)
2. In `Type Specialization.vi`, instrument type should be instrument name specified in the pinmap.  
   ![Type Specialization VISA](./docs/Images/README/Type%20Specialization%20VISA.png)

## Recommended Practices

1. Organize all the dependencies in a library for smoother conversion.
2. Place the dependencies in the same directory of the measurement, either in parallel or inside any
   folders.
3. Avoid modifying the project when conversion is in progress.
4. Ensure the libraries in the target project are not locked.
5. Have unique VI and Library names in all the iterations of conversion.

## Limitations

1. Measurement dependencies not part of any library must be placed in the same directory or
   sub-directories of the measurement.
2. Measurement modules must have at least one control and one indicator.
3. Measurement VI must not contain more than 26 controls and indicators in total.
4. Controls and Indicators label value must be unique.
5. User must wire the pins and session management VIs in the `Measurement Logic.vi`.
6. The Instrument drivers supported in InstrumentStudio apply to this tool too.
7. Tool wires only up to 7 IO controls to the connector pane of the wrapper. For more than 7 IO
   controls, the user must manually wire the controls to the connector pane.
8. For the unsupported datatypes, user must convert them into primitive datatype in configuration
   and results and implement all the serialization and deserialization logic in measurement UI and
   logic VIs.

## Known Issues

1. Measurements with IO Resource Name controls inside clusters are not converted as combo box
   control to list pin names.
2. Measurements VI with splitters in the FP results in a messy `Measurement UI.vi`.
3. Post conversion, some dependencies might be loaded from source location. To resolve that, add the
   dependencies from the folder found parallel to the measurement library.
4. Post conversion, LabVIEW project may not be saved. Save the project.
5. Measurements with complex controls like trees, table, list box, sub panel, class object are not
   supported.
6. Low-level, instrument-specific Initialize and Close APIs located inside any case structure, for
   loop, or while loop in the simple measurement VIs will not be disabled during conversion.
7. Copying the data from TestStand and pasting the data in InstrumentStudio doesn’t update the
   cluster controls.
8. Post conversion, Typedef constants placed inside the VI might not be linked to its typedef.
9. Post conversion, dependencies of the measurement may not be added to the new library created. To
   resolve this, add the libraries from dependencies to the new library manually.
